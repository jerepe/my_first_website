          <h1>My path, in a nutshell</h1>
          <h3>by Jeremy Perreau</h3>
          <hr>
          <h2>A bit about me</h2>
          <p>I am living in France and for the past 10 years i have been working as an Aircraft Fitter. I was doing maintenance jobs such as: a plane’s wing is damaged, we repair it, but, most of my time consisted of pretty repetitive jobs such as: painting the same part every day, fixing the same issue every day in factories, which was more often than not boring. But, for some reasons, i stuck to it.</p>
          <p>Even if yes i traveled to different countries, met tons of people coming from around the world, and had very good salaries (more often than not over 45k a year) i really didn't feel i was doing something fulfilling. No excitement at all coming from this job, no “motivating” perspective in mind, no sense of being useful at all.</p>
          <p>It took me to meet my girlfriend and with her strong support, plus obviously an open mind, she helped me figure out that, well, i should at least think about taking a path that really pleases me. Next questions that came to my mind were: how do i do that ? What can i do ?</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>So, what did i do next ?</h2>
          <p>I started doing something i wasn’t used to, which felt quite weird and stressful at times, asking myself: what do i wanna do my life ? Why do i wake up in the morning ? Do i really wanna do this … or that ? What could i try ? And one day, procrastinating through YouTube, i came across the video of a pretty eccentric guy trading, making good money from locations such as a beach in Bali.</p>
          <p>The thought that in order to work this guy just needed a laptop and a Wifi connection … wow … I never thought such a thing was possible ! This brought me to realize that actually, some opportunities out there could maybe be grasped by me as long as i had a laptop and Wifi connection ! This was new to me ! I wanted to do that too!</p>
          <p>As i absolutely had no clue of what this “finance world” was like … i needed to get familiar with it. After a few finance courses, some "trading rooms" … i learned! Took a lot of hard work and frustration (which often happens when one gets "his feet" into a seemingly strange and uncomfortable world) but i made some progress, and they seemed good to me ! I am not yet consistent, but have the belief, and the results, that tell me the chances to see this happening by the end of the year are for now on my side.</p>
          <hr>
        <h2>And i came to love coding, much more than trading</h2>
          <p>Following this path i came across "quants". In the trading world it basically means being good with computers, math, stats, working (or not!) for big companies, meeting tons of smart people … that truly sounded very good to me! The "coding seed” then kept growing stronger.</p>
          <p>So i started looking for more information. What could i find about this coding world ? Coming across the course of a guy named <a href="https://twitter.com/cypheralgos" target="_blank">Ryan</a> who was teaching how to automate trading using Python ... i loved the idea a LOT! It started occupying a lot more of my thinking. Back then, nothing was really exciting me that much, for such a long period of time. And when i realised that, i decided to jump on the “coding” train, and stick to it for good. I needed to know what i could do with myself from learning it.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Why Holberton School ?</h2>
        <p>The more i was coding, the more i was seeing myself doing that full-time, and not a single time it became boring. I just loved it. So i looked for BootCamps. Holberton didn’t come up before a few months in my radar, and luckily for me, conditions presented by other schools, especially the financing ones, didn’t make it possible for me to attend. Which ultimately brought me to Holberton.</p>
          <p>When i found out about their programming and blockchain course, i was hooked! My project needed those skills, and the “deepest” layers of programming really attracted me. “How does coding work ? What would i be able to create ?” Those ideas started bouncing often in my mind. I started the entry tests, and absolutely loved what followed. </p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>What i now have in mind</h2>
          <p>Back when i was a teenager, i sucked really hard at Math. When thinking about it, my thoughts were quickly getting chaotic. For some reasons i ignore, the last 2 years i kept feeling pulled towards it, thinking something like “i need to dig into this stuff”. Last year, after starting reading the book “How not to be wrong” from Jordan Ellenberg, i realised the reason i hated math was because i had no clue of what it was, and that i could get a lot learning it.</p>
          <p>So i decided to work on them and bought my first online “Math Fundamental” course, from Krista King. Not only was i pumped by the fact i COULD understand some math, and enjoyed it, but this also was the first time i enjoyed the way it was teached. As a result it seemed that my way of thinking improved by gaining more clarity and a better ability to organize my thoughts, and also, a very enjoyable feeling taking the shape of a boost in confidence in myself, arose … i was hooked with math, and immediately bought a second course, this time on Algebra I and II !</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>Why math now, and not a full focus on coding basics ?</h2>
          <p>I know the school could turn out to be pretty intense, and math will be involved. As i wanna make the best of it, i told myself i should learn some more. I’m still hesitating on what to learn. So here’s the list of the diverses courses i have in mind, in the order i've been told to take them, if my goal is to cover them all (it now is):</p>
          <p><ol>
              <li>Geometry</li>
              <li>Trigonometry & Precalculus</li>
              <li>Probabilities & Statistics</li>
              <li>Calculus 1, 2 and 3</li>
              <li>Linear Algebra</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Ideally, i would love to cover at least one math course, one C course, and one Linux course before the school starts. Why ? Because the Holberton’s cursus on “programming and blockchain” uses a lot of those three fields.</p>
          <p>I’m not entirely sure if this plan is a good idea, but so far it's the best i found. If you have any comments to make on that, please share ! Either through email, by commenting here, reaching out using the Holberton’s Level 2 website, Twitter … whatever suits your needs !</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>What’s next for this website ?</h2>
          <p>My goal is to keep developing this website and turn it into a blog that i’ll fill with my thoughts as time goes by. I have never done anything like this before, but as it could allow me to connect with more people (a lot is the goal!), and increase my chances to make interesting contacts, i 100% love the idea !</p>
          <p>A book that really helped me put this kind of idea into perspective, which i really had a hard time visualizing/understanding before, is “Show your work” by Austin Kleon. </p>
          <p>This picture speaks pretty good to me on what is coming: a lot of pleasure, combined with a lot of hard things, but armed with knowledge (the bicycle) you can get much further, and faster :)</p>
