        <h2>A brief dive into my process</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>So that's not the absolute starting point, but the idea was to first i play a bit with some basic concepts, like here, and add more content and then refine step-by-step:</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/R6rrSJw"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gWqq7cK/home1.png" alt="home1" style="border:0;"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>Cleaned a bit ...</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/7YTjp5S"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/98fc4Lp/home2.png" alt="home2" style="border:0;"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>I then added some more formatting, and really tried to go as step by step as possible, so i could feel more comfortable through developping a deeper knowledge.</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/ZhgvVxx"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gDWQ3JJ/home3.png" alt="home3" style="border:0;"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>Wrote some text, and after applying the school.css file, i was quite happy with the result, even if it kinda came by "magic".</p>
        <p>The background color is powderblue.</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/cbGWbS7"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k3RL3sW/home4.png" alt="home4" style="border:0;"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>Added <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a> which creates a comment/interactive section. Problem i faced was after a certain number of clicks the text color became white (as you can see on the picture).</p>
        <p>After playing a bit with the "Color Scheme" setup on the Disqus website, i decided to not spend much time on this issue as it was clearly not a priority: i activated the "Light" mode instead of the "Auto" (the other one being "Dark").</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/wJzr8M7"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YDLTJpX/Screenshot-2022-03-14-at-17-30-22.png" alt="Screenshot-2022-03-14-at-17-30-22" border="0"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>I then added two sharing buttons.</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/LvfcZ9T"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/M9LtCPz/Screenshot-2022-03-14-at-22-16-35.png" alt="Screenshot-2022-03-14-at-22-16-35" border="0"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>The final touch needed to complete the entrance tests was to align them. Done by using the code found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/727958/what-is-the-best-way-to-left-align-and-right-align-two-div-tags" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <a href="https://ibb.co/r4mn20N"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vZH24qR/Screenshot-2022-03-15-at-00-25-02.png" alt="Screenshot-2022-03-15-at-00-25-02" border="0"></a>
        <hr>
        <h4>Overall:</h4>
        <p>I really enjoyed the experience. Learning to use HTML, CSS and JS all in order to build my first blog (which was originally definitely not the objectif!) was great. I could do it again, this time much faster, so i'm happy with that. Add those facts to the mix:
          <ol>
            <li>i built skills which increase my overall "coding understanding"</li>
            <li>i can use those skills to maintain a blog that will lead me to connect to a lot more people</li>
          </ol>
          ... and you have a happy programmer!</p>
