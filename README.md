# My first website.

Website created using a VM hosted on an Ubuntu server and Apache2 server - originally.

Part of the second part of the entrance tests of the computer-science school Holberton.

**Done only using CLI and Emacs**

It wasn't supposed to be turned into a blog, but as i was building 
it, it stricked me "let's turn it into a website and 
put myself out there so i can connect with lots of people!"

The Linux server hosting the whole code was 
instantly turned down once i sent back my homework for review.

A bit before i copied all the codes, which i put aside waiting for an easy way to bring all that back online.

Then a Git & GitHub course mentionning Pages document made it possible,
and the website was borned again using only the CLI and Emacs one more time ;)
