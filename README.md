# My first website.

### It's here : [my first website](https://jerepe.github.io/my_first_website/)

> Website first created using a Ubuntu VM and Apache2 server as the second part of the Holberton Computer Science School's entrance tests.

**Done only using CLI and Emacs**

> It wasn't supposed to be turned into a blog, but as i was building 
> it, it stricked me "let's turn it into a website and 
> put myself out there so i can connect with lots of people!"
>
> The Linux server hosting the whole code was 
> instantly turned down once i sent back my homework for review.
>
> A bit before i copied all the codes, which i put aside waiting for an easy way to bring all that back online.
> Then a Git & GitHub course mentionning Pages document made it possible,
> and the website was borned again using only the CLI and Emacs one more time ;)

***NOTE :
> The first tweet on the "Tweets" page has since then been removed (you can see it on the "Renovations" page) hence why it is "weirdly" displayed there.
