# My first website.

I created this website when doing the second part of the entrance 
tests of the computer-science school Holberton.

It wasn't supposed to be turned into a blog, but as i was building 
it, it just stricked me "let's turn this stuff into a website and 
put myself out there so i can connect with lots of people!"

Unfortunately, the Linux server hosting the whole code was 
instantly 
turned down once i clicked on **I'm done with my project** in 
order to send it for review.

Fortunately tho, i copied just before all the codes, "just in 
case".
